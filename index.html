            <p>
              Sculpture is one of the oldest and most influential branches of fine art. It deals with the creation of
              three-dimensional forms using various materials such as stone, wood, bronze, metal, clay, marble, plastic,
              and others. Sculpture differs from painting in that it has a real, tangible volume and spatial existence —
              it can be viewed from different angles, walked around, and physically experienced.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sculpture can be round sculpture (fully three-dimensional, visible from all sides) or relief sculpture,
              when
              the image partially emerges from a flat surface (for example, sculptures applied to building facades or
              monuments).
            </p>
            <p>
              The history of sculpture begins in prehistoric times, when ancient humans made small stone or bone
              figurines
              as ritual or cult objects. In Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, and Rome, sculpture reached a high level
              of development, serving religious, state, and aesthetic purposes. Greek sculpture is especially renowned
              for
              its ideal proportions, its study of the beauty of the human body, and the expression of movement.
              From the Middle Ages onward, sculpture acquired a religious character, particularly in the decoration of
              cathedrals and churches. During the Renaissance, it once again became a reflection of the beauty of
              humanity
              and nature — thanks to masters like Michelangelo.

            <h3 class="h3">Armenian Sculpture</h3>
            <p>
              Armenian sculpture has a history spanning thousands of years. It began during the Urartian period (9th–6th
              centuries BC), when artists created bronze figurines of animals and deities, high reliefs, and
              architectural
              compositions.
            </p>
            <p>
              In ancient Armenia, the sculptures found on temples, tombs, and fortresses often served religious
              purposes.
              They depicted gods, heroes, animals, or symbolic motifs. For instance, the sculptural columns and ceramic
              decorations of the Garni pagan temple testify to the high artistic taste of that era.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the adoption of Christianity in 301 AD, Armenian sculpture gained a new spiritual content. A unique
              phenomenon emerged in Christian art — the khachkar (cross-stone): a carved stone monument shaped as a
              cross,
              which served as a religious, aesthetic, and national symbol. The fine engravings on khachkars — with
              intricate floral patterns, complex compositions, and diverse cross designs — became the most vivid
              expression of Armenian sculpture.
            </p>
            <p>
              Among the famous medieval masters was Momik (14th century), who was not only a sculptor but also an
              architect and miniaturist. His works, such as the khachkars of Noravank Monastery, are considered
              masterpieces of medieval Armenian sculpture.
            </p>
            <p>
              In modern times, Armenian sculpture continued to develop, embracing new materials, forms, and ideas.
              During
              the 20th century, renowned masters such as Ervand Kochar, Arpiar Sasouni, Getik Baghdasaryan, and Grigor
              Khanjyan (also known for monumental works) emerged.
              Ervand Kochar, in particular, became famous for his concept of “Man and the Universe” and his kinetic
              sculptures — a synthesis of sculpture and time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, Armenian sculptors create both monumental statues dedicated to historical figures (for example,
              Mesrop Mashtots, Hovhannes Tumanyan, Alexander Spendiaryan, and others) and contemporary artworks
              exhibited
              in international biennales and art shows.
